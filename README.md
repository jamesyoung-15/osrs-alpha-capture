# Old School Runescape Alpha Capture

Ongoing project for investment recommendation for Old School Runescape items based on the sub-Reddit posts in r/GrandExchangeBets and r/OSRSflipping. 

Basically recommends a list of items to buy/sell based on recent Reddit posts and analysis of price change before and after the post.

Idea from Alpha Capture System (used by hedge funds).
